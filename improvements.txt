mutli-category tier system
  category of item (coffees, pastries, etc.)
  name of item (latte, cappuccino, etc.)
  modifier (sm/md/lg, milk type, syrup, etc.)
    these should be toggles
    subtotal list should include these modifiers (that you can also add/remove)
    modifier values are additive only, item default is known to POS users
  categories should lead to different pages of items
  item buttons should open to modifiers
quantity modifier
change checkbuttons to just buttons
all clicked items should be in a list that you can remove as necessary from
  clear button can just clear from the list
discount buttons (bring-your-own-mug  50 cent discount, etc.)
25 cent button and 1 dollar button
checkout button (may not be necessary right away)
csv support
  need a way to add new items and prices from the app itself
  where will the csv file be kept?
  look into backend solutions for mobile apps

for now, just port what exists to be able to be on an android tablet
  force app to be landscape orientation

categorization is 3 tiers in: main category >> item >> modifiers
  keep an item total somewhere (visible would be nice) that you can zero as necessary when added to the total
"added items" area should be narrower and more to the right
modifiers to added items should also populate underneath the original item
buttons should be in grid, list will be left to right then down
  buttons should also be rectangular for easier fitting into UI
  main category buttons should be highlighted or not depending on which menu is open
  (see video for full UI workflow, including modifiers)
  also, see email for color palatte
switch "reset" button and "total" to be on opposite sides of where they are
add subtle lines between UI elements for cleaner look

[Dec 21 2025]
still to do:
  "EXTRA" menu needs proper item instantiation
  all items need proper prices
  currently only one type of modifier window is available, custom modifier windows still to come
