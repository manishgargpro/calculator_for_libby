mutli-category tier system
  category of item (coffees, pastries, etc.)
  name of item (latte, cappuccino, etc.)
  modifier (sm/md/lg, milk type, syrup, etc.)
    these should be toggles
    subtotal list should include these modifiers (that you can also add/remove)
    modifier values are additive only, item default is known to POS users
  categories should lead to different pages of items
  item buttons should open to modifiers
quantity modifier
change checkbuttons to just buttons
all clicked items should be in a list that you can remove as necessary from
  clear button can just clear from the list
discount buttons (bring-your-own-mug  50 cent discount, etc.)
25 cent button and 1 dollar button
checkout button (may not be necessary right away)
csv support
  need a way to add new items and prices from the app itself
  where will the csv file be kept?
  look into backend solutions for mobile apps

for now, just port what exists to be able to be on an android tablet
  force app to be landscape orientation
